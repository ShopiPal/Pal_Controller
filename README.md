# Overview
Pal the Robot is a B.Sc Final Project in Mechanical Engineering of the ShopiPal team from Tel-Aviv University (TAU).
The name 'Pal' was given due to the main agenda of the team which says that Robots  are a representation of combining fields of science in order to serve as a friend of the human beings for his own and for his environment benefits.

Pal is a mobile robotic platform capable of autonomously mapping, localizing, and navigating in indoor spaces. Such a platform can be an automated solution that is remotely controlled and useful for applications such as transporting loads from point A to point B and monitoring enclosed spaces such as warehouses, malls and supermarkets.

Main areas of the project were:
- Machanical & HW designing and requirments determination.
- Diffrential driving velocity controller designing and tuning.
- Wrapping scripts into ROS packages and configure it properly.
